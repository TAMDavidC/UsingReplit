  <h1> Welcome to David's website! </h1>
  <h3> I am happ to be here at home... again. </h3>
  <p> This will be added to Github </p>
  <p> work </p>
  <p> Well that took an hour kind of... so 
    I had this issue where I couldn't 
  commit to at all so I found this resource
  https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-github-codespaces-in-visual-studio-code
and now it works for some reason? As long as it works. </p>
